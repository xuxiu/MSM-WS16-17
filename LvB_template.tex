For any integer $n$ and any $\lambda$ not less than $\sqrt{log(2)/2}$
and $\gamma n^{-1/6}$where $\gamma=1.0841$, we have:
\[
 P(D_{n}>n)\leq exp(-2\lambda^{2})
\]

\begin{proof}


First Step:
\\where $n\geq39$ and $\lambda\leq\frac{\sqrt{n}}{2}$:
$C=3.61$\\
\\
Second Step:
\\ where $n\leq38$ and $\lambda>\frac{\sqrt{n}}{2}$:
$C=2$
